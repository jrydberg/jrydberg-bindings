jrydberg-bindings
=================

jrydberg-bindings generated bindgen-like data bindings for *GWT* (Google Web Toolkit).

These bindings are intended to be used with *gwt-pectin*, but pectin does not support
binding directly to a *HasValue* yet.  That's why there's a simple *Binder*-class included
with the sample.
